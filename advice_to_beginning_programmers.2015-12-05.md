## To the novice programmer

A good programmer is constantly trying to improve in his<sup id="fl1">[1](#f1)</sup> craft. He wants to be capable of building better, more beautiful and more efficient systems, but even more important to him than ability are the actual products of his labor.

Novice programmers are no exception to this rule. Just starting out in their careers they are usually passionate about learning and are eager to better themselves in their craft.

But sadly, time is a limited resource and soon they realize they cannot learn everything they put their minds to. There simply is not enough time in a day.

So they come and ask:
> "Given my time is limited and precious, I would like to optimize its use. So how can I best become a better programmer?".

Depending on the mentor or wise old bearded man that they ask, they will usually receive one of two answers, which are representative of two camps of common thought among software developers when it comes to bettering oneself at the craft of programming.

#### Two Camps

**Camp 1. Learn by doing:** The learn by doing camp will say that to become a better programmer you should build a lot of things,
just hack away making sure you finish the projects. Only by practicing the act of programming itself will you become a better programmer.

**Camp 2. Learn by studying:** The learn by studying camp is usually populated by a lot of programmers that are really computer scientists at heart. They will tell the new programmer he should learn all about algorithms and mathematics and data structures so that he may wisely construct programs when he decides to build them.

To whom should these young programmers give ear? Well, like most things in life its not a clear cut choice. Both camps have their pros and cons. 

For instance, programmers who strictly follow the guidelines in `learn by doing` will be able to quickly build working systems for almost all standard and even some more complicated tasks, conversely they will rarely be capable of solving problems that require more than a minimum of theoretical knowledge. The reverse is true of those in the `learn by studying` camp, they are generally quite adept and developing solutions to problems requiring theoretical knowledge, but when presented with real-world programming tasks will often require much more time and develop much poorer quality applications than their compatriots in the other camp.

#### Which Camp?

What do the camps have in common? Is there another option or at least a derivative method in which the novice programmer can maximize the benefits from both and minimize their negative aspects.

I think there is, otherwise this article would be rather pointless. I will call it `lazy learning` and it requires a novice programmer to adhere to following guidelines:

1. Make your main goal building software.
2. When studying, learn only things that will not change in the next 10-15 years (or better yet 20-30 years)
3. Do not actively pursue expertise in any software/hardware tool or language.
4. Build software by:
   - committing to memory only things that adhere to #2 and #3.
   - learning (for the duration of the software construction cycle) only things that are required to achieve #1, after which you can still feel good if they have completely slipped your mind.

If a programmer follows these guidelines I would expect them to be adept at building software (achieving the positive aspects of the `learn by doing` camp) but also be able to handle complicated tasks that require the development of new algorithms or usage of complex data structures (the pros of the `learn by studying` camp).


#### Summary
So is this a, "well, do both" type answer? I don't think so. It is true it requires the adherer to actively engage in the task of programming and to attempt to commit knowledge to long term memory, but at the very least by specifying which categories should be learned and what sorts of things it is fine to completely forget I think young programmers can feel better about themselves and the steps they take towards growth as a craftsman.

Lastly, Peter Norvig has written a widely aclaimed article entitled [Teaching yourself to program in ten years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html), which provides thought provoking material for the beginning programmer and an interesting perspective from a `learning by doing` advocate.
