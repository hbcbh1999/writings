## To the Junior Engineer

Here are a few things I wish someone had told me when I was just starting into my career.

It is probable that every Software Engineer, who has been in the business of building software for a decade or so, will have their own recommendations they nostalgically wish some veteran programmer had imparted to them back when they were starting their careers. 

These are mine.

1. Find out what you are worth.
2. Focus on learning static things
3. Concentrate on your ability to communicate
4. Don't live your work
5. Enjoy life outside of work


#### Find out what you are worth

Before accepting your first job be sure you have looked around at other opportunities available and gone through the whole interview process for multiple potential employers right up until the salary negotiation portion. Only then will you know, how much other companies are willing to offer you and only then can you make an accurate judgment whether you are earning enough or not.

Repeat this process at least once every 2 years if not every year, especially before talking to your boss about a new raise. This is not about earning the maximum possible, though it certainly will help overall in the long term, but it is rather about knowing what your value is and being prepared for how to react should you lose your job, become discontent with the current work situation, or find yourself in any situation where you need to change your employer. By doing this, you stay prepared and ready for the interview process and can accurately assess your worth to the company when receiving stock option offers or any monetary offer on the table.

#### Focus on learning static things

As a young engineer you will probably want to learn everything. Its great to be enthusiastic but realize that time is a limited resource and you will not be able to learn everything. With static things, I mean things that don't change rapidly. Avoid spending time learning technological things like a hardware or a software tool-set. Its fine to learn these if you need to for the job, but focus on tools you can take with you everywhere: Algorithms, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics and most importantly not only the theory in these fields but - now that you're working its easy - the applied parts as well.

Programming languages come and go from project to project. Stacks, Queues, Bags, and Sorting algorithms have been around much longer and withstand project and toolset change.

Its easy to look at shiny new technologies and want to jump in and try it out, don't do this. In reality you will more often than not simply waste time and not gain any new knowledge that will serve you well over your career.


#### Concentrate on your ability to communicate

Learn to write and speak well. When you write an email, even if its internal and informal, be sure to choose an apt summary for the subject, a succinct and precise body and an appropriate closing footer. Don't shy away from giving presentations and talking in front of people, learn to convey your ideas clearly and in an articulate way.

This, possibly more than anything else, will help you throughout your career. There are a vast number of software developers yet far too few who have the charisma, personality, and verbal and communication skills required to lead and manage a team.

At some point you will be in a management position and need all these skills. Start working on them from day one.


#### Don't live your Work

Its easy to let your enthusiasm and passion for software engineering to take over and dominate your life. Don't let it. Go to work, work 8 hours a day and go home. If you are required to work overtime once in a while that's fine and normal, if it becomes something regular, change workplaces. In 3 years of 60 hour weeks you will be 3 years older, have hacked out a lot of code and done little else. Make sure to keep your perspective straight, work is work and you get paid for 40 hours, so you give your best those 40 hours. That's as much as anyone can ask of you. Seriously.


#### Enjoy life outside of Work

Find a hobby, the less it has to do with programming or software/hardware etc. the better. Just make sure you are spending quality time outside of work doing things you enjoy that are not work related. If all you do is eat, sleep, or dream code, one day you will wake up and realize you never want to see another line of code in your life.

It doesn't matter what it is really, whether its playing a sport you enjoy, hanging out with friends, or just listening to music.

Be sure you are enjoying your life outside of work and doing something with all that money you are earning. 

Remember that some day you won't be young anymore and that older you will probably want to look back on the experiences of his youth with more coming to mind than a computer screen, null pointers and stack overflows.


c'est la fin.
