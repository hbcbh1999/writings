## Survivor Bias

Imagine you're a researcher fascinated by the paranormal. You think its possible that telepathic powers could exist, but like any good scientist you're skeptical, and want to rely only on hard data to verify your hypothesis.

You decide a good way to test whether or not someone has telepathic abilities is to get them to tell the name and suit of a randomly selected card, whose face only an assistant can see. The assistant is randomly assigned and you select 1 million participants randomly from the population.

You then start your study. You test all 1 million participants and about 20 thousand are able to tell you correctly which card and suit your assistant has. You then test these 20 thousand and of those about 400 answer correctly. Now you test those 400 and of these 8 confidently tell you the card and suit your assistant is holding.

After this you're ecstatic. Out of 1 million people you've found 8 which have been able to telepathically recognize the name and suit of the cards. The media rushes in and starts interviewing the telepaths. You get invited to talk shows and have suddenly achieved fame and glory.

But do these people really have telepathic powers?

The answer is of course no. We've made the fatal flaw of survivorship bias in our study. We assumed that those who survived our rounds of card quizzing would have to have some sort of telepathic powers, when in fact, pure random chance would predict almost exactly our results.

The key idea behind the survivorship bias, is that we tend to ignore or deemphasize failures and concentrate on and emphasize the winners or survivors in a given scenario. This leads us to vastly miscalculate the likelihood of success in a given domain and to erroneously associate attributes the winners might have with the reasons for there success.

It might be the case that an actor gets a few big film roles because of his skill in front of the camera or his method acting technique, but it might be just as likely that he gets these roles because he landed a role in a movie with an incredible director and that movie grossed hundreds of millions of dollars, leading executives to think that he is a fan favorite cash cow.

We can draw another example of survivorship bias from military problem solving in WWII. There Navy researchers wanted to minimize bomber losses due to enemy fire during mission deployments. At first, they analyzed the bombers which had returned from battle and planned to add extra armor to the areas which had been most heavily perforated. It was an Austro-Hungrian statistician named Abraham Wald, who realized that they were making the mistake of survivorship bias, since they were only sampling planes which had indeed returned, and he suggested that the areas with the most holes actually represented the places on a plane which could take the most damage. He then proposed that the Navy reinforce the undamaged areas of the aircraft, since those were likely the areas which when hit, caused the plane to crash.

Now let's examine how survivor bias might also influence western perceptions of other ethnic groups, specifically Asians. In order to immigrate into the US, most Asians need to have skills which are highly in demand. They need post-secondary degrees in a STEM field and enough money or a high paying job to fund their transfer from a distant country to a western one. This in turn feeds the stereotype that Asians are smart and that their cultural values lead highly productive individuals. Whether or not the Asian distribution of IQ turns out to be higher at the mean than that of other groups is irrelevant, since western perceptions are constructed on a biased sample derived from only the "survivors" of the arduous immigration process.


In summary, when you're looking at a system or a problem domain like firms in an economy or a historical event, don't forget to look at the failures just as much as those who succeeded if you want to obtain an unbiased full context view of the situation and be capable of making more accurate predictions in the future.

#### Notes

Gist:
1. People overestimate their chances of success.

Mitigate:
1. Visit / Revisit and study failed projects/ventures/careers, etc.

Some Examples:
1. Finance:
  - Only existing companies in a market are analyzed/studied. Problem? It ignores all the companies that tried to enter the market and went bankrupt i.e. failed.


Who is to blame?
1. The Press and Media?
2. Human Nature?

Big Errors:
1. Putting too much into similarities between the successful or winners in any scenario.
