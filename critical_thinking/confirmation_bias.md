## Confirmation Bias

Let's start with a challenge. What is something you have a strong belief in? It can be anything.
Do you believe its healthy to eat an apple a day or unhealthy to drink coffee? What about whether or not higher taxes lead to better living standards, or whether the death penalty is a good crime deterrent. Take a moment, grab that belief, and hold on to it.

Now imagine how you would find out whether or not that belief you hold is correct and accurate.

If you're like other people that psychologists have studied, then you would start out by looking for research and information that backs up what you believe, if you stumble across evidence along the way that contradicts your viewpoint, you'll also look for all the ways that counter evidence can be wrong and you'll be much more critical of the counter evidence than you are of any evidence that supports your belief.

This is confirmation bias.

Succinctly defined, confirmation bias is our innate tendency to search for and process information that conforms to our preexisting ideas and convictions [4].

Confirmation bias, like the mythological hydra, rears its heads ubiquitously and with such vehemence, that it can at times feel as if its impossible to overcome - and this may very well be the case. Still, if being cognizant of confirmation biases can help in any way its surely worthwhile to attempt to iron out errors in our belief sets and perhaps we can gain encouragement from Darwin, who spent his lifetime fighting against his own inherent confirmation biases, and once wrote the following:

"I had also, during many years, followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once;  for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favourable ones.  Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer." [3]

And so before we begin we have our first nugget for dealing with confirmation bias - write down counter evidence! It will at least force you to become aware of potential issues with your belief sets.

So broadly speaking there are three main areas in which confirmation bias manifest itself in the process of our everyday lives. We'll look at each one and explore examples in detail, all the while attempting to discover ways in which we can mitigate the problems this hydra of our biological hardware causes us when trying to arrive at accurate beliefs about any system.

#### Information Search

The first way confirmation bias reveals itself is during information search. If a journalist knows his readers are interested in conservative political slants, given any event, say congressional passing of a new tax law, he will begin his search through all the relevant information - how the law relates to society, congressmen and womens conversations, etc - with the intent on filtering out information which doesn't conform to a conservative view of tax policy. If, for instance, he stumbles across research showing that the new tax will increase human lifespan as well as decrease the overall cost of health care for the average American - perhaps the tax in question is a very high cigarette tax - he will likely ignore this information and concentrate instead on other factors such as a loss of freedom or an increasing government monolith which is more in tandem with his current views. Needless to say, the process unfolds itself the same way regardless of political affiliation.

Another example which illustrates how confirmation bias in the information searching process can lead us to erroneous conclusions, is exemplified in a game a professor played with his students to start the class every year. He showed them a piece of paper with the numbers 2-4-6 and told them their task was to guess the underlying rule which was written on the back of the sheet of paper. They could guess any number and he would tell them whether or not it conformed to the rule, but they could guess the rule only once. Most students would try 8, 10, 14, and perhaps even higher numbers, at which the professor would answer, "conforms to rule". They would eventually guess the rule was to "add 2 to the previous number". Do you think this is right answer? Well, it wasn't and one day there was a student who figured correctly figured out the answer. He asked numbers like -2, to which he got a response "doesn't conform" and then 7 to which he got "fits the rule" as a response. He tried tons more numbers -1000, 50, 101, etc. and finally guessed "the rule is: the next number must be higher than the previous one." And indeed, this was the answer written on the back of the sheet of paper.

What's interesting about this example is that it demonstrates how most of us look for information - we search for confirmation of a working hypothesis we have, we don't actively look for counter examples that could invalidate our model. That's what most of the students did, they tried a few examples, their tests seemed to confirm their model and so they incorrectly guessed. The other student actively pursued any possible flaw in his model actively searching for errors and updating his hypothesis as he arrived at new data. This approach is called negative testing and can be a useful approach towards mitigating some of our information searching bias.

Not only do our current beliefs and a desire to confirm them strongly effect how we navigate the new information landscape - leading us to choose confirmatory paths over disconfirmatory ones - but this also influences how we move along the paths we've already chosen, and this leads us to the second head of the hydra - biased interpretation.

In summary, to fight against confirmation bias when navigating through new information, question the choices you are making. Why are you reading this article, looking up that definition, or watching a certain video? Is it to confirm a belief you already have? Is it to find evidence against an error with your belief? Or is it to find errors and a better model for understanding the issue at hand?

Asking yourself these questions can help you think more clearly while underway in the sea of information you have available to you in today's post information revolution society.


#### Interpretation

After navigating the information landscape and choosing what pieces of data we want to look at, we have to interpret that data, and as you might have guessed this process of interpretation is also susceptible to confirmation bias. If we think eating apples is a healthy endeavor we're much more apt to be lenient on studies and research that confirms that belief while simultaneously being much more critical on any counter evidence - and this holds regardless of the participants intelligence levels, leaving a tenured Phd. Professor just as vulnerable to this type of error as a high school drop out [5].

It seems Paul Simon was on to something in the Boxer when he wrote "A man sees what he wants to see and disregards the rest".

Great examples for how confirmation bias shows up during interpretation reveal themselves anytime politics creeps in to a conversation. One study done in this area conducted MRI scans of people who were presented with a series of contradictory statements made by political candidates. When presented with contradictory statements made by their preferred candidate, emotional regions of the brain lit up - something that didn't happen for the statements made by other candidates. Other studies in this area have also shown that given a list of candidates' contradictory statements and then some more statements that make the previous ones seem reasonable, participants are much more likely to interpret the statements of the candidate they dislike as being contradictory, whereas they tend to rationalize those of their own preferred candidate.

Knowing we have this interpretive bias is there anything we can do about it? One thing that might help is to ask yourself if you are having an emotional reaction to something. Also try looking at the data through different filters. Ask yourself, "Would you think differently about what this politician was saying it was said by the other candidate?"


#### Memory & Recall

The third and last area we'll look where confirmation bias plays an important role is during memory recall i.e. remembering.

We can think of remembering as a variation on information searching. When we try to remember something, we start searching through our own memories and recollections of events with a particular goal, whether that goal is remembering what someone said or whether or not we turned off the lights before leaving the house. Having this focus biases us in the way we interpret and look for those memories.

For example, if a manager review survey given to employees has the question, "How happy are you with your Manager? Give examples if possible." Then employees will be much more likely to write a favorable review and provide more favorable examples, possibly even viewing negative interactions with the manager in a more positive light. If, on the other hand, the question were phrased, "How unhappy are you with your Manager? Give examples if possible." The opposite will be the case. Depending on the question, the employees will have been primed to start remembering in a certain way, either positive or negative.

To fight against confirmation bias during remembering things, try to focus on why you are remembering something in a particular way, and be honest with yourself about what you are leaving out.


#### Summary

To sum things up, we've seen that we tend to look for, interpret, and remember things that confirm our current beliefs and values. This is confirmation bias. We can mitigate these innate tendencies which cloud our thoughts and give us false perceptions of reality through a number of ways.

We can actively look for contrary evidence to our particular beliefs. We can escape our social echo chambers where everyone agrees with us and interact with people of different views and beliefs. We can ask ourselves why or to what end a lot. We can ask why we are looking for a particular piece of data (is it because it confirms our belief?), why we are interpreting that datum in a particular way, why are we discrediting some evidence and giving credit to other evidence.

At the end of the day, our confirmation biases are powerful beasts difficult to overcome, but if we're strong and diligent and committed to improving our beliefs and values iteratively over time, there is hope and it starts with knowing what to look for and asking a simple question, "why?".

#### Notes


__information search__

Confirmation Bias as a problem with the information searching process.

People tend to do diagnostic test and then positive test and not negative ones.

Confidence Level : in belief increases as people seek out more contradictory information

Rule Discovery : confirmation tests not falsification tests

__biased interpretation__

__biased belief__

Darwin's Quote on fighting against confirmation bias:

"I had also, during many years, followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once;  for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favourable ones.  Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer."

How to fight confirmation  bias: "Look for exceptions and evidence that contradicts your own view."

Examples:
1. Religious Zealots
2. Journalists trying to create a story
3. Internet echo chambers
